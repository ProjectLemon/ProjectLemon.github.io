Today Project Lemon participating in a hackaton at the local company Acino. Linus is not with us today but instead, our friend Jacub is 
standing in for him.The theme of the evning is Internet of things. We decided to design a smart wardrobe. Who can help you keep track of 
your clothes. It can give you proposals of today's clothing by taking weather, day and your personal style into account. It is also 
possible to use it for online shopping and try the clothes on virtually in the mirror. 

To simulate how the wardrobe will work we will make a webbsite and a presentation. We will present it in a few a hours and hopefully the
jury and all the other participators like our idea.
