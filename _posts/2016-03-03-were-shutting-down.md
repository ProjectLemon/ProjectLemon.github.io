When I say that *"We're shutting down"* I don't actually mean that the group Project Lemon is shutting down, it's just that one of our projects [Intense Orange](https://github.com/ProjectLemon/intense-orange) is coming to its end, or at least put on hold. As a first blog post this might seem like a strange topic but I believe it's a fitting one.

Intense Orange was an idea for a party game where people would gather around and play a series of mini games, using their phones as controllers. In some ways this was too big of a project for us to manage as pretty much all of us couldn't put in the time and effort needed to complete the project. And most of the project just ended up trying to get the Android Direkt Wifi API to work as we wanted, together with the difficulty of actually testing/debugging network connected devices this project simply had to put on hold.

However, on the bright side this actually allows us to start new, smaller projects that can actually completed in a reasonable timeframe, for example this blog. We got some great ideas that is just waiting to be implemented.
