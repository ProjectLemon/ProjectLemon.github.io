Today we began our new project by spending the afternoon working on the
specifikation. We already had the idea but today we sat down and wrote together
a piece of documentation stating exactly what kind of funtionality we wanted to
have, which functionality we should build first and so on. We also drew up som
besic design sketches for the application UI.         

The application will be a web application where the user can create a profile
and then uppload their portfolio as a pdf-file for display. This will be for
those who don't have the time, or knowledge to build their own portfolio as a
website but still want to be able to show the world what amazing work they have
made.

We were planing to write the server side of the application and the client side
in Angularjs
