Mattias argument is that a kebab roll got one top and a bottom and it's a 50/50 chans that you will open it in the right way.  
This argument is stupid.  
First of all the when making the pizza there's no speciell concideration taken for the sides to make them different. Of course when wrapping the roll you have to start in one end, but to say that that will determine if that side is top or bottom is ludicrous. The top is simply the side that you open on, nothing else.  
And also, there is no difference between a kebab roll and a rolled kebab no mather what Mattias sais.
